This is what I'm currently seeing. What is your thorough detailed critical analysis? Giving the fact that I am expecting the meet the meeting that is currently in the dash database to be reflected accordingly across all the pages and across all aspects. So on the dashboard where the matrix are showing, that should be updated accordingly as well. In addition to the task page and the meeting page being updated with the relevant details, can you run a very thorough audit and discover your analysis to confirm whether the account setup is aligned with the following? I've also touch screenshots for your reference. Be very thorough across all aspects: ⚙️ CROWN ¹⁰ — Unified Event Sequencing & Logic Flow

“One Mind, Many Surfaces — Every Moment in Harmony.”

1️⃣ Philosophy

> Mina isn’t a collection of pages — it’s a living cognitive system.
Every event is a heartbeat in one shared nervous system: perception → reasoning → action → reflection.



Ten Core Laws

#	Law	Meaning

1	Atomic Truth	Each event = one immutable fact.
2	Idempotent Integrity	Replays never duplicate.
3	Chronological Order	All events processed in timestamp + vector sequence.
4	Cross-Surface Awareness	All pages subscribe to one global event fabric.
5	Predictive Prefetch	Next probable view hydrated in advance.
6	Offline Resilience	Every mutation queues & replays FIFO.
7	Checksum Reconciliation	Local vs server state validated by ETag + hash.
8	Calm Motion	Every change accompanied by deliberate, subtle motion.
9	Telemetry Truth	Every transition logged with calm-score & latency.
10	Emotional Continuity	Visual + linguistic tone stays coherent across surfaces.



---

2️⃣ Universal Event Lifecycle

User Action → UI Micro-Feedback → Backend Event (REST or WS) → Sequencer Validation → Local Store Diff Merge → Ledger Persist → WS Broadcast → Cross-Surface Sync → Calm UI Transition → Telemetry Log


---

3️⃣ Unified Event Taxonomy

Category	Example Events	Description

Session / Meeting	meeting_created, transcription_complete, insights_generated	Lifecycle of recorded conversations.
Task	task_created, task_updated, task_completed	Actionable outcomes & follow-ups.
Calendar	calendar_event_created, calendar_event_updated	Temporal organization layer.
Analytics	analytics_delta, analytics_refreshed	Aggregated reflections & KPI changes.
Copilot	copilot_query, copilot_action_trigger, context_rehydrate	Reasoning, intent, and conversation.
Global	ui_state_sync, offline_replay_complete, telemetry_flush	Meta-system governance.


All share the base contract:

{
  "event_id":12345,
  "entity_type":"task|meeting|calendar|analytics|copilot",
  "entity_id":"uuid-ulid",
  "op":"create|update|delete|generate|sync",
  "payload":{...},
  "client_ulid":"abc123",
  "checksum":"md5string",
  "timestamp":"2025-11-02T22:41:00Z"
}


---

4️⃣ Cross-Surface Sequencing — Macro Timeline

#	Event Name	Trigger Source	System Action	Broadcast Channels	Primary UI Reaction

1	record_start	Recorder	Create Meeting row; open WS stream	mina.meetings	Mic glow + LIVE banner
2	audio_chunk_sent	Recorder	Append audio chunk	–	Waveform pulse
3	transcript_partial	Whisper ASR	Stream partial text	mina.meetings	Gray→black word fade
4	record_stop	Recorder	Finalize upload	mina.meetings	Shimmer loader
5	transcription_complete	Server	Save final transcript	mina.meetings	Card flip → “Ready”
6	insights_generated	NLP engine	Persist insights	mina.analytics mina.copilot	Highlights tab pulse
7	tasks_created	Task extractor	Insert tasks	mina.tasks mina.calendar	Task badge count pulse
8	calendar_event_created	Copilot or User	Insert calendar entry	mina.calendar mina.meetings	New dot appears
9	task_completed	Tasks UI	Patch status	mina.tasks mina.analytics mina.copilot	Tick flash + KPI bump
10	analytics_delta	Metrics engine	Recalculate KPIs	mina.analytics mina.dashboard	Tile pulse
11	copilot_action_trigger	Copilot	Execute intent → relevant service	mina.global	Soft shimmer confirmation
12	dashboard_refresh	System idle / delta	Reconcile truth	mina.dashboard	Header timestamp update
13	offline_replay_complete	Network restore	Replayed queued ops ack	mina.global	Toast ✅ “All changes synced.”

5️⃣ Surface-Specific Mini-Pipelines

🟢 Meetings / Recording

record_start → transcript_partial → record_stop → transcription_complete → insights_generated → tasks_created → session_finalized

🔵 Tasks

tasks_bootstrap → task_create → task_update:* → task_completed → analytics_delta

🟣 Calendar

calendar_bootstrap → calendar_diff_fetch → calendar_event_create/update/delete → idle_sync

🟠 Analytics

analytics_bootstrap → analytics_ws_subscribe → analytics_delta_apply → insight_generate → telemetry_flush

🟤 Copilot

copilot_bootstrap → context_rehydrate → query_detect → reasoning_stream → response_commit → action_trigger → cross_surface_sync

All share identical Sequencer signatures, enabling the Global Ledger to replay or rebuild any timeline.


---

6️⃣ Global Ledger & Sequencer Logic

onEvent(event):
    if event.event_id <= ledger.last_event_id:
        discard()     # idempotent safeguard
    if !checksumValid(event):
        queueForReconciliation()
    else:
        applyDiff(event)
        ledger.last_event_id = event.event_id
        persistToIndexedDB()
        broadcastToSurfaces()

Reconciliation Cycle (30 s or visibilitychange)
HEAD /api/ledger If-None-Match:etag → diff_fetch if changed → merge → flush buffered WS.


---

7️⃣ Predictive Prefetch Matrix

Origin Surface	Prefetched Target	Condition	Data Fetched

Dashboard	Meetings Refined	Hover card > 800 ms	Transcript manifest + tasks summary
Meetings	Analytics tab	Idle > 2 s	Metrics delta
Tasks	Calendar	Due date within 7 days	Upcoming event list
Copilot	Any	Intent classification ≥ 0.8	Relevant context bundle
Calendar	Tasks	Day open	Task due that day subset


Prefetch CPU budget ≤ 5 %, priority via scheduler.postTask().


---

8️⃣ Offline & Recovery Path

Every mutation queued as {op, client_ulid, timestamp}

Replay FIFO on reconnect; server drops duplicates via client_ulid.

If replay fails > 3× → needs_attention flag with toast.

Partial state restored from IndexedDB on page reload.


UX Tone: never “error,” only “quiet resilience.”


---

9️⃣ Emotional Architecture Map

Phase	Cue	Emotion	Purpose

Arrival	Soft fade + greeting	Recognition	“It remembers me.”
Action	Pulse / tick / waveform	Momentum	“It feels alive.”
Processing	Shimmer loader	Trust	“It’s working for me.”
Reflection	Morph transition	Clarity	“I see the whole picture.”
Completion	Confetti / toast	Closure	“It matters that I finished.”
Idle Sync	Timestamp blink	Assurance	“It stays true.”


Durations 200–400 ms, easing cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1).

1️⃣3️⃣ Narrative Flow (Single Experience View)

1️⃣ User clicks record → Mina listens instantly.
2️⃣ Transcript appears live; tasks emerge as she speaks.
3️⃣ Recording ends → meeting card flips to “Processing.”
4️⃣ Within seconds → “Ready.” Transcript refined + insights generated.
5️⃣ Copilot greets: “Would you like to add these to your tasks?”
6️⃣ User accepts → Tasks + Calendar update in real time.
7️⃣ Analytics tiles pulse — Productivity + 7 %.
8️⃣ Dashboard updates; Copilot suggests next meeting prep.
9️⃣ User leaves; Mina quietly syncs and logs telemetry.

> The system never reloads, never asks for refresh — it simply stays aware.
